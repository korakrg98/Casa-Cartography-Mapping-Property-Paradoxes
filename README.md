# Casa-Cartography-Mapping-Property-Paradoxes



This project presents a comprehensive approach to predicting house prices tailored to individual preferences. Leveraging a diverse array of machine learning models including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, MLP, and XGBoost, the system estimates house prices based on user-provided requirements.

The predictive accuracy was enhanced through rigorous hyperparameter tuning, resulting in a remarkable mean absolute error reduction and an impressive RÂ² score of 0.90. Analyzing influential factors influencing house prices allows users to comprehend the critical variables impacting predictions.

In addition to accurate price estimations, the project introduces a recommender system enabling users to explore similar societies based on their preferences. The integration of spatial analysis techniques facilitates the mapping of properties with their respective prices, providing a visual representation of price distributions across regions.

The deployment of this predictive system is realized through Streamlit, ensuring a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction. Future plans involve expanding this model to encompass multiple cities, enabling users to obtain predictions tailored to their selected city. Moreover, ongoing efforts are directed towards integrating a chatbot interface to further enhance user experience and accessibility.

Looking ahead, the project aims to implement Bayesian hyperparameter tuning to refine predictions further. By continually improving the model's accuracy and usability, this project endeavors to provide users with precise and insightful real estate price predictions, contributing to informed decision-making in the real estate market.
